## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This is my first Frontend Mentor problem. I decided to do it without using any libraries or frameworks, just straight HTML and CSS. 

It was a good practice starting from scratch as I had to revisit some of the most basics CSS properties.

I chose to use article HTML element as my container element as I gather a QR Code is a shareable part of any website and it makes sense on its own.

```html
<article class="cardHolder">
    ...
</article>
```
